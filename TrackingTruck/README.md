## API Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the backend API routes:

### Public Routes
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /location-logs` - Public location tracking
- ESP32 integration endpoints

### Protected Routes
- User profile management
- Vehicle CRUD operations
- Location tracking and logging
- Fuel management
- API key management

### Admin Routes
- User management
- System-wide vehicle access
- Administrative dashboards

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure API Base URL**
   The API base URL is already configured to match your backend at `https://trackerapi/api/v1`.
   You can modify it in `src/config/environment.ts` or by setting environment variables.

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
